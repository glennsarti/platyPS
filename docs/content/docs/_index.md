PlatyPS provides a way to:

* Write PowerShell External Help in Markdown
* Generate markdown help ([example](docs/Update-MarkdownHelp.md)) for your existing modules
* Keep markdown help up-to-date with your code

Markdown help docs can be generated from old external help files (also known as MAML-xml help), the command objects (reflection), or both.

PlatyPS can also generate cab files for [`Update-Help`](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849720.aspx).
